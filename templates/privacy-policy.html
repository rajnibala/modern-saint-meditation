            <p>Your privacy is important to us. This privacy policy explains what personal data we collect and how we use it.</p>
            

            At Modern Saint Meditation, we strive to provide the best meditation experience possible. However, if you are not satisfied with your purchase, we offer a refund policy as outlined below:

            1. **Eligibility for Refund**:
               - Refunds are available for annual subscription packages only.
               - A refund can be claimed before two wellness sessions and only the first month’s fees will be charged.

            2. **Refund Process**:
               - To request a refund, please contact our customer service team at [your contact email] with your purchase details.
               - Once your request is received and reviewed, we will notify you of the approval or rejection of your refund.

            3. **Refund Amount**:
               - If approved, your refund will be processed, and a credit will automatically be applied to your original method of payment within 7-10 business days.
               - The refund amount will be the total annual payment minus the cost of the first month's package. For example, if you paid ₹10,000 for a year and request a refund before attending two wellness sessions, you will be refunded ₹10,000 - (₹10,000/12) = ₹9,167.

            4. **Partial Refunds**:
               - Only regular priced items may be refunded; unfortunately, promotional items cannot be refunded.

            5. **Late or Missing Refunds**:
               - If you haven’t received a refund yet, first check your bank account again.
               - Then contact your credit card company, it may take some time before your refund is officially posted.
               - Next contact your bank. There is often some processing time before a refund is posted.
               - If you’ve done all of this and you still have not received your refund yet, please contact us at [your contact email].
