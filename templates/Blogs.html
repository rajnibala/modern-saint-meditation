    <h4>**Fear of Irritation and Endangerment:**</h4>
               <p>Individuals dealing with anxiety may find themselves in a state of constant fear, even in the absence of an actual cause for danger. This fear can lead to irritability, as well as a sense of being endangered, further contributing to the cycle of anxiety.</p>
    
     <h4>**Low Tolerance Power:**</h4>
            <p>Anxiety can significantly lower one's tolerance for stress and challenging situations. What others might perceive as manageable, individuals with anxiety might find overwhelming. This can further perpetuate their anxious feelings and make it harder to cope.</p>
